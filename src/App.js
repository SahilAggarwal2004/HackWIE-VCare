      description="Environmental racism is inequitable distribution of environmental hazards based on race. The Federal Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry considers lead poisoning to be the number one environmental health problem for children in the United States. Some 4 million children worldwide have dangerously high lead levels in their bodies absorbed from contaminated drinking water and soil polluted by industrial effluents and automobile exhaust." />,

This difference between births and deaths means a net gain of roughly 2.5 more humans per second in the world population. This means we are adding 9,000 per hour, 217,000 per day, or about 79 million more people per year." />,

The total volume of ice released was the equivalent to 29 trillion bags of party ice. Climatologists warn that this dramatic collapse could be a signal of global climate change and an omen of catastrophic events to come." />,
